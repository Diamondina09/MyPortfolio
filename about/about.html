    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>When I started learning p5.js, I was unaware of the capabilities on this platform. At first, I felt like the program was limited to mere image drawing through JavaScript. However, as I continued to use it, I learned a lot and was amazed by how I was able to code projects such as games, movable interactions, and much more. Overall, this course was very educational and eye-opening.</p>
