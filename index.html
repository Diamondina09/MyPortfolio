    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Uttara Ranjit. I am studying at Parsons School of Design. I am majoring in Design and Technology. I am currently pursuing the game design pathway and am excited to continue that journey. My skills include C#, Python, Javascript and HTML. My hobbies include reading and watching movies. I particularly love the fantasy genre, my favourite series being a duology written by Leigh Bardugo named Six of Crows. My interest of movies is linked to my passion for filmmaking and storytelling. I hope to pursue film sometime in the future. </p>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>When I started learning p5.js, I was unaware of the capabilities on this platform. At first, I felt like the program was limited to mere image drawing through javascript. However, as I continued to use it, I learned a lot and was amazed by how I was able to code projects such as games, movable interactions, and so much more. Overall, this course was very educational and eye-opening.</p>
